# flutter_app3

Demo Flutter project.

## Working

This project is a demo app made for megathon 19 for a Flutter application.
It fetches data from a static database hosted on Firebase.
You can't run this app on your system as it requires access to that Firebase project.

Anyways you can understand the code and then create a sample database according to the app for which you can run this app.
